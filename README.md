# CatRelax
CatRelax is an Android app that provides feline-friendly entertainment for cats on the go.
It includes several bird videos which play in full-screen.
The app's PawPoints show how many times your cat touches the screen while each video is playing so you know his favorites.

CatRelax was created for [CS491] (http://cs.unm.edu/~pgk/HMADs15/) at the University of New Mexico in spring 2015.


Videos were recorded at [ABQ BioPark Zoo] (https://www.cabq.gov/culturalservices/biopark/zoo/zoo) and
[Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge] (http://www.fws.gov/refuge/bosque_del_apache/).
